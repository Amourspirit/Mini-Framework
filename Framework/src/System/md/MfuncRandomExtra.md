### Comments based on the original source

This function uses the Mersenne Twister random number generator, MT19937, written by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto, Shawn Cokus, Matthe Bellew and Isaku Wada.

The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers. It was designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators. The period, 219937-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions, are far greater. The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and division, and it benefits from caches and pipelines. For more information see the inventors' web page at www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html

Do NOT use for CRYPTOGRAPHY without securely hashing several returned values together, otherwise the generator state can be learned after reading 624 consecutive values.

When you use this, send an email to: matumoto@math.keio.ac.jp with an appropriate reference to your work. It would be nice to CC: rjwagner@writeme.com and Cokus@math.washington.edu when you write.

This above has been already been done for AutoHotkey, but if you use the Random command in a publicly distributed application, consider sending an e-mail to the above people to thank them.
