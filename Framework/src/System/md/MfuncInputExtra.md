### Options Parameter  
A string of zero or more of the following letters (in any order, with optional spaces in between):

**B**: Backspace is ignored. Normally, pressing backspace during an Input will remove the most recently pressed character
from the end of the string. Note: If the input text is visible (such as in an editor) and the arrow keys or other means
are used to navigate within it, backspace will still remove the last character rather than the one behind the caret (insertion point).

**C**: Case sensitive. Normally, MatchList is not case sensitive (in versions prior to [1.0.43.03], only the letters A-Z are
recognized as having varying case, not letters like ü/Ü).

**I**: Ignore input generated by any AutoHotkey script, such as the [SendEvent](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Send.htm#SendEvent){_blank}
command. However, the [SendInput](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Send.htm#SendInput){_blnak} and
[SendPlay](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Send.htm#SendPlay){_blank} methods are always ignored, regardless of this setting.

**L**: Length limit (e.g. `L5`). The maximum allowed length of the input. When the text reaches this length, the Input will be
terminated and ErrorLevel will be set to the word Max unless the text matches one of the MatchList phrases, in which case 
[ErrorLevel](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/ErrorLevel.htm){_blank} is set to the word Match.
If unspecified, the length limit is 16383, which is also the absolute maximum.

**M**: Modified keystrokes such as Control-A through Control-Z are recognized and transcribed if they correspond to
real ASCII characters. Consider this example, which recognizes Control-C:
> Transform, CtrlC, Chr, 3 ; Store the character for Ctrl-C in the CtrlC var.
> Input, OutputVar, L1 M
> if OutputVar = %CtrlC%
> 	MsgBox, You pressed Control-C.
> ExitApp  
Note: The characters Ctrl-A through Ctrl-Z correspond to [Chr(1)](http://ahkscript.org/docs/Functions.htm#Chr){_blank} through
[Chr(26)](http://ahkscript.org/docs/Functions.htm#Chr){_blank}. Also, the M option might cause some keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl-LeftArrow to misbehave while an Input is in progress.

**T**: Timeout (e.g. `T3`). The number of seconds to wait before terminating the Input and setting
[ErrorLevel](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/ErrorLevel.htm){_blank} to the word Timeout. If the Input times out,
return value will be set to whatever text the user had time to enter. This value can be a floating point number such as 2.5.

**V**: Visible. Normally, the user's input is blocked (hidden from the system). Use this option to have the user's keystrokes sent to the active window.

*: Wildcard (find anywhere). Normally, what the user types must exactly match one of the MatchList phrases for a match to occur. Use this option to find a match more often by searching the entire length of the input text.

Can be [MfString](MfString.html) instance or var containing string.

### EndKeys Parameter  
A list of zero or more keys, any one of which terminates the Input when pressed (the EndKey itself is not written to OutputVar).
When an Input is terminated this way, [ErrorLevel](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/ErrorLevel.htm){_blank} is set to the word EndKey followed by a colon and the name of the EndKey. Examples: `EndKey:., EndKey:Escape`.

The *EndKey* list uses a format similar to the [Send](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Send.htm){_blank} command.
For example, specifying {Enter}.{Esc} would cause either ENTER, period (.), or ESCAPE to terminate the Input.
To use the braces themselves as end keys, specify `{{}` and/or `{}}`.

To use Control, Alt, or Shift as end-keys, specify the left and/or right version of the key, not the neutral version.
For example, specify `{LControl}{RControl}` rather than `{Control}`.

Although modified keys such as Control-C (^c) are not supported, certain keys that require the shift key to be held down -- namely punctuation marks such as ?!:@&{} -- are supported in [v1.0.14+].

An explicit virtual key code such as `{vkFF}` may also be specified. This is useful in the rare case where a key has no name and
produces no visible character when pressed. Its virtual key code can be determined by following the steps at the bottom fo the
[key list page](http://ahkscript.org/docs/KeyList.htm#SpecialKeys){_blank}.

Can be [MfString](MfString.html) instance or var containing string.

### MatchList Parameter  
A comma-separated list of key phrases, any of which will cause the Input to be terminated (in which case 
[ErrorLevel](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/ErrorLevel.htm){_blank} will be set to the word Match). The entirety of what the user
types must exactly match one of the phrases for a match to occur (unless the
[\* option](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Input.htm#asterisk){_blank} is present). In addition,
**any spaces or tabs around the delimiting commas are significant**, meaning that they are part of the match string.
For example, if MatchList is "ABC , XYZ ", the user must type a space after ABC or before XYZ to cause a match.

Two consecutive commas results in a single literal comma. For example, the following would produce a single literal comma at
the end of string: "string1,,,string2". Similarly, the following list contains only a single item with a literal comma
inside it: "single,,item".

Because the items in MatchList are not treated as individual parameters, the list can be contained entirely within a variable.
In fact, all or part of it must be contained in a variable if its length exceeds 16383 since that is the maximum length of any
script line. For example, MatchList might consist of `%List1%,%List2%,%List3%` -- where each of the variables contains a
large sub-list of match phrases.

Can be [MfString](MfString.html) instance or var containing string.

### ErrorLevel  
[v1.1.04+] This command is able to throw an exception if called with no parameters and there is no Input in progress. For more information,
see [Runtime Errors](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors){_blank}.  
	* 1 or 0 - Whenever the command is used without parameters, ErrorLevel is set to 0 if it successfully terminates a prior input, or 1 if there is no Input in progress.
	* NewInput - The Input was interrupted by another [thread](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/Threads.htm){_blank} that used the Input command.
	* Max - The Input reached the maximum allowed length and it does not match any of the items in MatchList.
	* Timeout - The Input timed out.
	* Match - The Input matches one of the items in *MatchList*.
	* EndKey:name - One of the EndKeys was pressed to terminate the Input. In this case, [ErrorLevel](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/ErrorLevel.htm){_blank} contains the word EndKey followed by a colon and the name of the terminating key without braces, e.g. "EndKey:Enter", "EndKey:Escape", etc.

### Returns  
If the parameters are omitted, any Input in progress in another [thread](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/Threads.htm){_blank} is terminated
and its [ErrorLevel](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/ErrorLevel.htm){_blank} is set to the word NewInput. By contrast,
the [ErrorLevel](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/ErrorLevel.htm){_blank} of the current command will be set to 0 if it terminated
a prior Input, or 1 if there was no prior Input to terminate.

Return value does not store keystrokes per se. Instead, it stores characters produced by keystrokes according to the active
window's keyboard layout/language. Consequently, keystrokes that do not produce characters (such as PageUp and Escape) are not
stored (though they can be recognized via the EndKeys parameter below).

Whitespace characters such as TAB (`t) are stored literally. ENTER is stored as linefeed (\`n).

### Remarks  
Wrapper for [AutoHotkey Docs - Input](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Input.htm){_blank}.  
Static method.  

If this command is used while an Input is already in progress in another [thread](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/Threads.htm){_blank},
that Input will be terminated and its ErrorLevel will be set to the word NewInput.
After that (if parameters were given), the new Input will commence.

While an Input is in progress, new [threads](http://ahkscript.org/docs/misc/Threads.htm){_blank} such as
[custom menu items](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Menu.htm){_blank} and
[timed subroutines](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/SetTimer.htm){_blank} can still be created. Similarly, keyboard
[hotkeys](http://ahkscript.org/docs/Hotkeys.htm){_blank} are still in effect if the Input is
[visible](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Input.htm#vis){_blank}. If the Input is not visible, only
[hook hotkeys](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/_UseHook.htm){blank} can be triggered.

When a script first uses this command, the [keyboard hook](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/_InstallKeybdHook.htm){_blank} is
installed (if it is not already). In addition, the script becomes [persistent](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/_Persistent.htm){_blank},
meaning that [ExitApp](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/ExitApp.htm){_blank} should be used to terminate it.
The keyboard hook will stay installed until the next use of the [Suspend](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Suspend.htm){_blank} or
[Hotkey](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Hotkey.htm){_blank} command, at which time it is removed if not required by any
hotkeys or hotstrings.

If you use multiple languages or keyboard layouts, Input uses the keyboard layout of the active window rather than the script's (regardless of whether the Input is [visible](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/Input.htm#vis){_blank}). However, in versions prior to [1.0.44.03], the script's own layout is used.

Although not as flexible, [hotstrings](http://ahkscript.org/docs/Hotstrings.htm){_blank} are generally easier to use than
the Input command.
